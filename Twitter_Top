Top Tweets
Retrieve Tweets sorted by engagement and (optionally) republish them via a Twitter bot.

Retrieve top Tweets
Use get_tweets.py to retrieve, sort, filter, and return the top Tweets of Twitter user accounts.

Create an instance of Account using either a username or user ID
Use get_top_tweets_num() to retrieve the top top_num Tweets (list of Tweet) from the previous num_days, based on metric
Use get_top_tweets_percent() to retrieve the top top_percent Tweets (list of Tweet) from the previous num_days, based on metric
Tweet instances have attributes including the Tweepy Status object, type of Tweet, ID, content, engagement metrics, and publish time
More detailed documentation is provided within the class and method docstrings
For example...

# Instantiate the account using a Twitter username
account = Account(username="example_twitter_username")

# Retrieve the top 10 Tweets based on their number of Likes (in order from highest to lowest Likes) 
# from the previous 30 days (including the current day)
tweets = account.get_top_tweets_num(30, "likes", 10)
Republish top Tweets
Use bot.py to Retweet or Quote Tweet the top Tweets of Twitter user accounts.

Create an instance of Bot, optionally providing a default list of usernames or user IDs to share from and a default metric to sort/rank Tweets by
Use share_from_user() to Quote Tweet or Retweet a top Tweet (that hasn't already been shared) by a specific user, from the previous num_days based on metric
Use share_from_random_user() to Quote Tweet or Retweet a top Tweet (that hasn't already been shared) by a randomly selected user from a list, from the previous num_days based on metric
If the #1 Tweet has already been shared then the #2 Tweet will be shared instead, and so on
Quote content includes the account, Tweet rank (e.g. number 1), metric, num_days, and (optionally) additional hashtags (see also: changing the Quote Tweet content)
More detailed documentation is provided within the class and method docstrings
For example...

# Instantiate the bot using a default list of Twitter usernames
bot = Bot(usernames=["example_user_1", "example_user_2", "example_user_3"])

# Quote Tweet a top Tweet from a random user in the default list, 
# published in the previous 7 days (including the current day),
# where `likes_retweets_combined` is used by default to sort/rank Tweets
bot.share_from_random_user(7, quote=True)
@TechTopTweets1 demonstrates the bot in action, implemented via main() in bot.py.

Setup
Requirements can be found in requirements.txt. The project has been developed and tested using Python 3.9, but is likely to be compatible with other recent versions of Python 3.
Create a config.py file using config_sample.py as a template. Instructions for acquiring the required Twitter API credentials can be found in Twitter's documentation.
FAQs
Is the Twitter API used directly?
This project was built using Tweepy, specifically version 3.10.0, which is used to access version 1.1 of the Twitter API.

Thanks to the Tweepy team!

Are there any limits?
Yes, the Twitter API's standard rate and request limits apply. Exceptions/errors relating to limits aren't explicitly handled, but tweepy.API (editable in twitter_auth.py) can be configured to wait for rate limits to replenish.

More details can be found in Twitter's API v1.1 rate limits documentation.

Can I change the Quote Tweet content?
For simplicity, Quote Tweet content isn't editable via public Bot methods. However, you can edit how this content is constructed in the Bot._get_quote_content() method.

How can I ask questions, report bugs, or provide feedback?
Feel free to create an issue or open a new discussion.

Is this project in active development?
There are no further updates/features planned, and I'm not looking for contributions, but I'll be happy to fix any (significant) bugs.
